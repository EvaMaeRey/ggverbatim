The goal of ggverbatim is to ...

## Installation

You can install the released version of ggverbatim from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("ggverbatim")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("EvaMaeRey/ggverbatim")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
# library(ggverbatim)
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)

Titanic %>% 
  data.frame() %>% 
  tibble() %>% 
  uncount(Freq) %>% 
  count(Survived, Sex) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = Sex, values_from = n) ->
vis_arrangement

vis_arrangement
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
vis_arrangement %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -1, names_to = "Sex") %>% 
ggplot() + 
  aes(x = Sex) + 
  aes(y = Survived) + 
  aes(label = value) + 
  aes(fill = value) + 
  geom_tile() + 
  geom_text() + 
  scale_x_discrete(position = "top")



```
