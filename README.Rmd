# ggverbatim

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of ggverbatim is to reproduce visual table arrangement of tabular input to ggplot2.  It feels a bit wrong; not likely to pursue further. 

## Installation

Install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("EvaMaeRey/ggverbatim")
```

## Motivation 

ggplot requires 'tidy' data, usually 'long'.  You may build a table in ggplot2, the visual arrangement isn't tidy, but is nice for humans.

Sometimes, you will have data in an untidy format (your raw data or data that you've already worked wth).  And you might just want to reproduce it ggplot2 'verbatim'.  

Currently, this would be accomplished via a pivot to long (unpivot) and then repivot in the visual.  That is what ggverbatim actually does under the hood.  But if feels like a A -> A process, not an A -> B -> A process.  



```{r example}
# library(ggverbatim)
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)

Titanic %>% 
  data.frame() %>% 
  tibble() %>% 
  uncount(Freq) %>% 
  count(Survived, Sex) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = Sex, values_from = n) ->
vis_arrangement

vis_arrangement
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
vis_arrangement %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -1) %>% 
ggplot() + 
  aes(x = name) + 
  labs(x = "Sex") + 
  aes(y = Survived) + 
  aes(label = value) + 
  aes(fill = value) + 
  geom_tile() + 
  geom_text() + 
  scale_x_discrete(position = "top") + 
  scale_y_discrete(limits=rev)
```




# Therefore

```{r}
readLines("R/ggverbatim.R") ->
verbatim_code
```

```{r, code = verbatim_code}

```


```{r}
vis_arrangement %>% 
  ggverbatim(rows_var = Survived) + 
  geom_text() + 
  geom_tile(alpha = .2) +
  labs(x = "Sex")

```
